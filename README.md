# masterclass-typescript
This is a tutorial from Rocketseat about using TypeScript on React projects and on NodeJS based servers.

In this tutorial I learned how to set up TypeScript for a web app. This repo is based in:

- [NodeJS](https://www.nodejs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Consider hiring me as Front-end developer 👨‍💻!
